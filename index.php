    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Veronica Gable. Thank you all for taking the time to explore my IT162 website.</p>
    <p>I've always been drawn to the front end aspect of web development. I believe that in order to have a great product, it should not only be visually appealing, but it needs to also<em> work </em>seemlesy and effectively.</p>
    <p>During my time in the Web Design program at SCC, I hope to learn all the essential skills in order to develop properly working websites.</p>
